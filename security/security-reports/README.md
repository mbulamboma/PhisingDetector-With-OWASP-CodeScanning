# Security Reports

This directory contains vulnerability scan reports generated by OWASP Dependency Check.

## Report Files

- `dependency-check-report.html` - Human-readable HTML report (main report to review)
- `dependency-check-report.json` - Machine-readable JSON format
- `dependency-check-report.xml` - XML format for CI/CD integration

## How to Read the Reports

### HTML Report (Recommended)
Open `dependency-check-report.html` in your browser. Look for:

- **Summary section**: Shows total number of vulnerabilities found
- **Vulnerability tables**: Lists each dependency and its vulnerabilities
- **Severity levels**: 
  - 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Fix immediately
  - 🟠 **HIGH** - Fix soon  
  - 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Fix when convenient
  - 🔵 **LOW** - Monitor, fix if easy

### Key Information
For each vulnerability, check:
- **CVE ID**: Official vulnerability identifier
- **CVSS Score**: Numerical severity (0-10, higher = worse)
- **Description**: What the vulnerability does
- **References**: Links to more info and fixes

## Common Flask/Python Vulnerabilities

Watch out for these common issues:
- **Outdated Flask versions** - Can have XSS or injection flaws
- **Insecure dependencies** - Libraries with known security holes
- **Development dependencies in production** - Debug tools that shouldn't be deployed
- **Weak cryptography libraries** - Outdated crypto that can be broken

## Fixing Vulnerabilities

1. **Update dependencies**: `pip install --upgrade package-name`
2. **Pin versions**: Update `requirements.txt` with fixed versions
3. **Test thoroughly**: Make sure updates don't break functionality
4. **Re-scan**: Run the security check again to verify fixes

## Automation

Consider adding this to your development workflow:
- Run weekly or before releases
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines
- Set up alerts for new vulnerabilities

## Note

- Reports are generated locally and not tracked in git
- This folder is automatically created by the security scan scripts
- Delete old reports periodically or they'll accumulate
